                <h1>NO.1 What is Achain?</h1>
                <p>
                    Achain is a <span>public blockchain platform</span> enabling developers of all levels of experience to issue tokens, smart contracts, create applications and blockchain systems. Achain is committed <span>to building a global blockchain network
                            that facilitates information exchange and value transactions.</span></p>
                <p>
                    Achain was originally developed by the Singapore-based nonprofit organization, Achain Foundation, which is co-constructed and co-maintained by its community members around the world. At its early stage of development in 2015, Achain proposed its blueprints
                    of technological innovations, including modular design and smart sandbox, which cultivates a more stable and secure network for decentralized applications on its platform.</p>
                <p>
                    As blockchain technology made further advancement, Achain, in 2017, proposed its three-phase development plan of <span>"Smart Contract Network"</span>, <span>"Fork Network"</span>, and <span>"Interconnected Network"</span>. Achain
                    then began the in-depth research and development of Sub-chains, BaaS, Event-Driven Mechanisms and Safety Isolation.

            <div class="no two">
                <h1>NO.2 What kind of consensus agreement is Achain using? Is ACT mineable?</h1>
                <p>Achain uses DPoS (Delegated Proof of Stake) consensus mechanism, which occupies less resource, creating the Result-delegated Proof of Stake (hereinafter referred to as RDPoS) consensus mechanism. Under the same security situation, RDPoS
                    provides better transaction performance of the entire network as well as other parameters of the network as a whole. Theoretically, it has reached or even exceeded 1,000TPS (Transaction Per Second). This is based on the DPoS mechanism,
                    ACT is not mineable.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="no three">
                <h1>NO.3 What programming languages does Achain support?</h1>
                <p>Achain provides a tool called IDE that allows anyone to release smart contracts on Achain, which is located within the Achain Wallet application. Currently, Achain only supports Lua programming language, however, we plan to integrate more
                    languages like Java, Python, Go, etc. Java will be available in 2018.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="no four">
                <h1>NO.4 What is the block size and generation time of each block?</h1>
                <p>The maximum block size is 10Mb and the interval time of each block is 10 seconds.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="no five">
                <h1>NO.5 What is the cost and speed associated with each transaction?</h1>
                <p>Each transaction should be confirmed within 1 minute, however, it is ultimately determined by the network traffic. Each transaction costs about 0.01 ACT.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="no six">
                <h1>NO.6 How does Achain achieve 1,000 TPS?</h1>
                <p>The RDPoS consensus mechanism provides a more efficient transaction performance of the network compared to the others. In addition, Achain further increases the network speed by increasing the block capacity, reducing the interval of block
                    generation, and optimizing the code for higher efficiency.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="no seven">
                <h1>NO.7 How do I generate my ACT address?</h1>
                <p>You can either download the PC wallet (here) and generate your ACT address following the Guide (here). Or you can download the Kcash Wallet (here) to your phone for it as well.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="no eight">
                <h1>NO.8 What is Achain's development plan?</h1>
                <p>
                    We had released the three-phase development plan of Singularity - <span>"Smart Contract Network"</span>, Galaxy - <span>"Fork Network"</span>, and Cosmos - <span>"Interconnected Network"</span>.</p>
                <p>
                    The first stage is to enhance the Achain network's security and stability. Smart contracts, digital assets, and sandbox simulations are made available through the methodology of modular design. Sandbox can automatically test and monitor the environment
                    where the newly created smart contracts operate. Thereby they ensure that those contracts run stable and safely within the Achain network.</p>
                <p>
                    Achain is now at Galaxy stage where it splits into multiple sub-chains to meet the need for different applications in the reality, including insurance, e-documentation, cryptocurrency, record investigation, credit rating, and much more can be fulfilled
                    by sub-chains within an interconnected, low-cost, user-friendly, and customized blockchain network.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="no night">
                <h1>NO.9 Where can I trade ACT?</h1>
                <p>ACT is listed in over 10 major international exchanges including Okex, Ourdax, KuCoin, Coinegg etc.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="no ten">
                <h1>NO.10 How many Assets or Smart Contracts have been launched on the Achain platform? Please introduce them.</h1>
                <p>Achain is an open-sourced blockchain platform where developers can issue their smart contracts via the Achain Wallet. There are over 30 smart contracts issued <span>(https://browser.achain.com/contract.html#/)</span> and over 10 Dapps
                    were released by our record. (Dapps)</p>
